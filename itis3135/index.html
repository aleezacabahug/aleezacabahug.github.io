            <h2>Page Information</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">Personal Background:</span> I was born in Queens, New York City and raised in Northern New Jersey. I moved to Cary, NC in 2021 then to Charlotte in 2022 for college. Since then, I have loved it here and plan to live here permanently in the future.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Professional Background:</span> I currently work at Mr. Tokyo as a server. It is an all you can sushi restaurant so running food and fast/good service is important to the job. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Academic Background:</span> I am currently a senior pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science. I am also currently enrolled in the accelerated master's program for cybersecurity. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Primary Computer Platform:</span> Windows 11</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Background in this Subject:</span> Took a software engineering class but wasn't really taught HTML and CSS in depth but I am still comfortable with it as long as I have a refresher. </p>
            <p class ="bold">Courses I'm Taking & Why:</p>
            <p class="indent"><span class="bold">ITIS 3246 - </span>IT Infrast and SEC: Wanted to learn more in depth and refreshers for HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p class="indent"><span class="bold">MATH 2164 - </span>Matrices and Linear Algebra: A requirement for major and thankfully, my very last math class ever. Praise the lord!</p>
            <p class="indent"><span class="bold">ITIS 6200 - </span>Principles of Information Security & Privacy: I wanna learn more about network security, malware analysis, and cryptography. </p> 
            <p><span class="bold">Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</span> In New Jersey, I got bit by (what I think was) a brown recluse spider which initially, left a blue crater on my left shoulder. I was supposed to lose my arm but I didn't. Wild story but eventually, it healed into a keloid. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">I'd also like to Share:</span> I have a cat named Nezuko and a dog named Arizona and they are both my pride and joy. I also love playing video games like valorant, elden ring, and the new game wukong. I have traveled to Calgury for hiking and went on a cruise this summer for the first time.</p>

            <h3>Contract</h3>
            <p>I, ALEEZA CABAHUG agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER ITIS3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: <span class="italics">Aleeza Cabahug,</span> 9/5/2024</p>
