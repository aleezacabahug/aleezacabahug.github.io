            <li><p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Queens, New York City and raised in Northern New Jersey. I moved to Cary, NC in 2021 then to Charlotte in 2022 for college. Since then, I have loved it here and plan to live here permanently in the future.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently work at Mr. Tokyo as a server. It is an all you can sushi restaurant so running food and fast/good service is important to the job. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am currently a senior pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science. I am also currently enrolled in the accelerated master's program for cybersecurity. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> Took a software engineering class but wasn't really taught HTML and CSS in depth but I am still comfortable with it as long as I have a refresher. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</strong></p></li>
            <li><p class="indent"><strong>ITIS 3246:</strong>IT Infrast and SEC - Wanted to learn more in depth and refreshers for HTML and CSS.</p></li>
            <li><p class="indent"><strong>MATH 2164:</strong>Matrices and Linear Algebra - A requirement for major and thankfully, my very last math class ever. Praise the lord!</p></li>
            <li><p class="indent"><strong>ITIS 6200:</strong>Principles of Information Security &amp; Privacy - I wanna learn more about network security, malware analysis, and cryptography. </p> </li>
            <li><p><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> In New Jersey, I got bit by (what I think was) a brown recluse spider which initially, left a blue crater on my left shoulder. I was supposed to lose my arm but I didn't. Wild story but eventually, it healed into a keloid. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I have a cat named Nezuko and a dog named Arizona and they are both my pride and joy. I also love playing video games like valorant, elden ring, and the new game wukong. I have traveled to Calgury for hiking and went on a cruise this summer for the first time.</p></li>
