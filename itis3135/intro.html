            <li><p><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> In New Jersey, I got bit by (what I think was) a brown recluse spider which initially, left a blue crater on my left shoulder.

            <li><p><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I have a cat named Nezuko and a dog named Arizona and they are both my pride and joy. I also love playing video games like valorant, elden ring, and the new game wukong. I have traveled to Calgury for hiking and went on a cruise this summer for the first time.</p></li>
